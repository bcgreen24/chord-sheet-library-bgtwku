You want to build a mobile app for importing, editing, and viewing chord sheets, with a library, setlists, and offline functionality. Here's a plan for the initial version:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Chord Sheet Library:** A screen to display a searchable list of chord sheets.\n-   **Chord Sheet Viewer/Editor:** A screen to view and edit individual chord sheets.\n-   **Setlist Creation:** Functionality to create and manage setlists from the chord sheet library.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6E798C` (Grayish Blue)\n    *   Primary: `#A9927D` (Taupe)\n    *   Secondary: `#D6CFC7` (Light Grayish Brown)\n    *   Accent: `#EAC4A3` (Pale Goldenrod)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#BDB2FF` (Periwinkle)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the code changes.\n\n1.  **Create the basic tab structure:** The app already has a tab structure, so we'll modify the existing tabs.\n2.  **Implement the Chord Sheet Library:** Create a component to display the list of chord sheets. For now, this can be a simple list with placeholder data.\n3.  **Implement the Chord Sheet Viewer/Editor:** Create a component to display and edit a single chord sheet. This will initially be a simple text area.\n4.  **Implement Setlist Creation:** Add functionality to create and manage setlists. This will involve creating a new screen and components to add/remove songs from setlists.\n5.  **Implement Offline Functionality:** This will require storing the chord sheets locally. Since Supabase is available, we could use it, but for the initial version, we'll use the device's local storage.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to include a Chord Sheet Library component. This component should display a list of chord sheets (placeholder data for now).\n2.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/chordSheet.tsx` to implement the Chord Sheet Viewer/Editor. This component should display a single chord sheet and allow editing.\n3.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/setlists.tsx` to implement the Setlist Creation functionality. This component should allow creating and managing setlists.\n4.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include the new tabs for \"Chord Sheet\" and \"Setlists\".\n5.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented these changes, the app will have the basic structure and functionality for importing, editing, and viewing chord sheets, with a library and setlists.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T14:53:02.992679"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a mobile app for importing, editing, and viewing chord sheets with a library, setlists, and offline functionality.

The `expo-document-picker` should be configured to allow multiple selections.\n*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Implement asynchronous processing to handle multiple file imports efficiently. This could involve using `Promise.all` to process files concurrently.\n*   **Progress Indicator:** Add a progress indicator to provide feedback to the user during the import process, especially when handling multiple files.\n*   **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling to manage potential issues during PDF parsing or file storage, providing informative messages to the user.\n\nThis enhancement will significantly improve the user experience by streamlining the import process and supporting a wider range of file formats.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T15:14:08.216031"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you add PDF support and multiple file import functionality to your chord sheet app. Let me first search for relevant information and then read the current implementation."}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/chordSheetParser.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.ios.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/chordSheet.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "package.json", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Let me get more information about the DocumentPicker API:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me search for information about PDF parsing in React Native:"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Based on my research, I can see that:\n\n1. **expo-document-picker** already supports multiple file selection (though the current implementation doesn't use it)\n2.

These errors can halt the execution of the app and result in a blank screen.\n\n    *   **Check Runtime Logs:** Use the `read_runtime_logs` tool to inspect the Expo development server logs for any error messages. These logs will often pinpoint the exact line of code where the error occurred. Look for red text or lines starting with \"ERROR\".\n2.  **React Native Rendering Issues:** Problems within React Native components can also lead to a blank screen.\n\n    *   **Check Component Rendering:** Examine the code for your main components (especially in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` and any parent components) for potential issues like incorrect data being passed, missing return statements, or errors within the render function.\n3.  **Dependency Issues:** Incompatible or missing dependencies can sometimes cause the app to fail silently.\n\n    *   **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies (especially `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`, `expo-document-picker`, and `pdfjs-dist`) are correctly installed and that their versions are compatible with your React Native and Expo versions.\n4.  **AsyncStorage Issues:** If there's a problem accessing or writing to AsyncStorage during the app's startup, it could prevent the app from loading correctly.\n\n    *   **Check AsyncStorage Usage:** Review the code in `utils/storage.ts` and in the components that use it to ensure that you're handling AsyncStorage operations correctly (e.g., using `await` when necessary) and that you're handling potential errors.\n5.  **PDF Parsing Issues:** Since you recently added PDF parsing functionality, errors in the `pdfParser.ts` module could be the culprit.\n\n    *   **Check PDF Parsing Logic:** Carefully examine the `parsePdf` function in `pdfParser.ts` for any potential errors, such as issues with `pdfjs-dist` configuration or incorrect handling of PDF content.\n6.  **Import Issues:** Problems in the import functionality could also be the cause.\n\n    *   **Check Import Logic:** Review the `importChordSheet` function in `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` for any potential errors, such as issues with `expo-document-picker` or incorrect handling of imported files.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T15:20:39.822545"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you troubleshoot this blank white screen issue.

I've implemented the platform-specific solution for viewing PDFs. Here's what I did:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n### 1. Created `CustomWebView` Component (`components/CustomWebView.tsx`)\nThis new component handles platform-specific rendering:\n- **Web Platform**: Uses an HTML `iframe` element to display PDFs directly in the browser\n- **Native Platforms (iOS/Android)**: Uses the `WebView` component from `react-native-webview`\n\nThe component accepts the same props as the original WebView, making it a drop-in replacement.\n\n### 2. Updated `chordSheet.tsx`\n- Replaced the direct import of `WebView` from `react-native-webview` with the new `CustomWebView` component\n- The rest of the logic remains unchanged, ensuring PDFs work seamlessly across all platforms\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen a PDF chord sheet is displayed:\n- On **web browsers**, the PDF is rendered using a standard `iframe` element, which browsers natively support\n- On **iOS and Android**, the PDF is rendered using the native WebView component, which can display PDFs natively\n\nThis solution ensures that your chord sheet app can now view PDFs on all platforms without any errors!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-11-19T16:08:05Z"}]
