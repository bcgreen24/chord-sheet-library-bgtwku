You want to build a mobile app for importing, editing, and viewing chord sheets, with a library, setlists, and offline functionality. Here's a plan for the initial version:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Chord Sheet Library:** A screen to display a searchable list of chord sheets.\n-   **Chord Sheet Viewer/Editor:** A screen to view and edit individual chord sheets.\n-   **Setlist Creation:** Functionality to create and manage setlists from the chord sheet library.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#2E294E` (Dark Indigo)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#6E798C` (Grayish Blue)\n    *   Primary: `#A9927D` (Taupe)\n    *   Secondary: `#D6CFC7` (Light Grayish Brown)\n    *   Accent: `#EAC4A3` (Pale Goldenrod)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#BDB2FF` (Periwinkle)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the code changes.\n\n1.  **Create the basic tab structure:** The app already has a tab structure, so we'll modify the existing tabs.\n2.  **Implement the Chord Sheet Library:** Create a component to display the list of chord sheets. For now, this can be a simple list with placeholder data.\n3.  **Implement the Chord Sheet Viewer/Editor:** Create a component to display and edit a single chord sheet. This will initially be a simple text area.\n4.  **Implement Setlist Creation:** Add functionality to create and manage setlists. This will involve creating a new screen and components to add/remove songs from setlists.\n5.  **Implement Offline Functionality:** This will require storing the chord sheets locally. Since Supabase is available, we could use it, but for the initial version, we'll use the device's local storage.\n\nHere's the plan for the coding agent:\n\n1.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to include a Chord Sheet Library component. This component should display a list of chord sheets (placeholder data for now).\n2.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/chordSheet.tsx` to implement the Chord Sheet Viewer/Editor. This component should display a single chord sheet and allow editing.\n3.  Create a new file `app/(tabs)/setlists.tsx` to implement the Setlist Creation functionality. This component should allow creating and managing setlists.\n4.  Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include the new tabs for \"Chord Sheet\" and \"Setlists\".\n5.  Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented these changes, the app will have the basic structure and functionality for importing, editing, and viewing chord sheets, with a library and setlists.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-19T14:53:02.992679"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a mobile app for importing, editing, and viewing chord sheets with a library, setlists, and offline functionality.
